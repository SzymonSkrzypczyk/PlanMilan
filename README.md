# PlanMilan

## Purpose
Planning a trip can be **time-consuming**, especially when trying to fit everything into a limited schedule. This project helps simplify the process by generating a well-structured itinerary based on the destination and trip duration. It takes into account factors such as trip duration and its location and creates a plan that maximizes the fun!

## How to run 
In order to learn in detail how to run the app head over to `app/` and `frontend/` directories to learn about *backend* and *frontend* respectively. The general flow of running the app is as follows:
    1) acquiring a Gemini API key and save it either as an environment variable or a key/value pair inside `app/.env` file
    2) running the FastAPI API using either `uvicorn` or directly by running the script 
    3) running the Go Wails app using `wails dev` command   
    4) enjoy ;)

## Use of AI 
The app heavily utilizes Artificial Interface for its main feauture and purpose, which is generating a plan of any given trip, the underlying model is **Gemini 2.0 Flash** provided by **Google**
